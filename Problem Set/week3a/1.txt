a.path
smallest: any path with one edge (e.g. a-b or g-m)
largest: some path including all nodes (e.g. m-g-h-k-i-j-a-b-c-d-e-f)

b.cycle
smallest: need at least 3 nodes (e.g. i-j-k-i or h-i-k-h)
largest: path including most nodes (e.g. g-h-k-i-j-a-b-c-d-e-f-g) (can't involve m)

c.spanning tree
smallest: any spanning tree must include all nodes (the largest path above is an example)
largest: same

d.vertex degree
smallest: there is a node that has degree 1 (vertex m)
largest: in this graph, 5 (b or f)

e.clique
smallest: any vertex by itself is a clique of size 1
largest: this graph has a clique of size 5 (nodes b,c,d,e,f)
